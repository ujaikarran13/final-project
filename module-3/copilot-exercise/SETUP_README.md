# AI with Copilot Setup

## Timing

This exercise fits best in Module 3, toward the end of the program. However, you can adjust the exercise and timing to best fit your cohort schedule as it's somewhat independent of the LMS content and exercises. The more experience the students have with Vue, the more comfortable they'll feel with client portion of the `ShopApplication` exercise, however you could minimize or remove that portion of the exercise to accommodate an earlier session.


## GitHub Copilot

**IMPORTANT** You must request Copilot access for your students at least two days in advance.

GitHub Copilot isn't a free service. However, the program provides students access to Copilot for one month.

There is a GitHub group that provides Copilot access. You must collect your students' GitHub usernames specifically for this exercise. Most students already have a user account on GitHub from Prework or Pathway, but if not, they'll need to create one.

- Collect your student's [GitHub](https://github.com/) usernames.
- Make a copy of the [TE Student github copilot user group tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yn4g4eLt0X0qlt7plT7Lf_R99JgA4hNpz35GJeToxk8/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet and fill it out for your cohort. Share this as indicated in the instructions at the top of the spreadsheet.
- Post a note in the [Slack #curriculum-support](https://techelevator.slack.com/archives/C019ZMVTW8Z) channel with a link to the spreadsheet and the date you plan to run your session.
    - If you don't have Copilot access as an instructor, you can also request access here.
    - You can also use this channel for real-time support. Please tag **@james.rogers** or **@Zubair** so they get notified.


## Planning

> AI is a rapidly changing space. GitHub Copilot is also an evolving tool, and it's features and capabilities may also change quickly and dramatically. This may create more instability in these materials than is typically found in the curriculum.

### PC Setup

The VS Code extensions required to use GitHub Copilot aren't currently part of the student image. However, there are installation instructions in the LMS unit **Intro to Tools: GitHub Copilot**.

You may want to set aside additional time for troubleshooting support before starting the exercise.

### Exercise

The goal is for the students to gain exposure to and experience with AI tools. To support this, you can customize the provided exercises for your cohort to accommodate the length and timing of your session.

- The Getting Started exercise provides setup instructions and an introduction to the code completion and chat tools using both Java and JavaScript.
The `ShopApplication` is a working Spring Boot server with a Vue front-end. These exercises include activities for both the client and server, with familiar patterns and new patterns that the students can learn about and explore using AI chat.

It's recommended that you work through the Getting Started application as is. However, there's a lot of material in the `ShopApplication` exercise. You know your cohort best. Feel free to alter this exercise to meet the needs and timing of your session and cohort.
