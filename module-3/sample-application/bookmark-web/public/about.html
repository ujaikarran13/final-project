            <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
            
            <p>The following set of Community Guidelines outline the type of content and behavior we 
            expect from our user community. These policies apply to all types of content, including 
            usernames, links, images, and comments. The Community Guidelines are regularly updated
            based on customer feedback and the input of outside experts to stay current with the 
            most recent challenges.</p>

            <p>Our aim is to ensure this application is inclusive and safe, and a valuable resource for 
            our user community. To support this, these Community Guidelines are enforced by our 
            administrative staff, with the assistance of the user community. These policies are 
            applied equally to everyone, regardless of subject or users background, political views, 
            or affiliations.</p>

            <p>We expect all members of our community to:
                <!-- Example: static HTML vs. DOM -->
                <!-- This ul is intentionally incorrectly nested in the p for a lecture demonstration -->
                <!-- The browser will interpret this to end the previous p -->
                <ul>
                    <li>Share fun and useful content.</li>
                    <li>Treat others with respect, acting with maturity and consideration for others.</li>
                    <li>Respect the privacy and personal information of others.</li>
                    <li>Keep content relevant and in good taste.</li>
                    <li>Report any content which violates these guidelines.</li>
                </ul>
            <!-- Because the browser already closed the previous p, seeing the ending p tag here, 
                 it will add a new opening p tag to "fix" it as best it can. -->
            </p>

            <p>We will take action against any content that is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>illegal</li>
                <li>offensive (racist, sexist, or otherwise)</li>
                <li>explicit or pornographic</li>
                <li>hateful or inflammatory</li>
                <li>spam, inauthentic or misleading</li>

            <h2>Bookmark Visibility</h2>
            <p>Bookmarks may be either private or public.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Private bookmarks are only visible to you. The application does not permit 
                    anyone else to view or edit your Private bookmarks.
                </li>
                <li>Public bookmarks are visible to all users of the application. Bookmark Manager 
                    administrative staff moderate Public bookmarks, and may edit or delete them 
                    as appropriate for the overall experience of the community. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>When creating a new bookmark, you can control access to your bookmark by setting the visibility.</p>
            <p>If you decide later that you want to change the visibility of one of your own bookmarks, you may
                do this from the My Bookmarks page. There are two ways to do this:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the Visibility icon <i class="fa-solid fa-users"></i> for the bookmark.</li>
                <li>Click the Edit icon <i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i> for the bookmark, then select the desired 
                    visibility using the select control.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>User Profile</h2>
            <p>
                All users have a public profile which is referenced from any Public Bookmarks shared. Profile information 
                is optional, but gives other members of the community an opportunity to learn a little about you. This 
                profile includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>your display name if provided, otherwise your username is used</li>
                <li>your profile image</li>
                <li>an optional, short paragraph about you, labeled "Short bio"</li>
                <li>a list of all Public Bookmarks you have shared</li>
