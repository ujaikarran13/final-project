# Command-line exercises

Complete the following exercises. Each exercise is a separate project found in the same directory as this README.

## Make Change

Write a command-line program which prompts the user for the total bill, and the amount tendered. The program then displays the change required.

```
Please enter the amount of the bill: 23.65
Please enter the amount tendered: 100.00
The change required is 76.35
```

## Martian Weight

In case you've ever pondered how much you weigh on Mars, here's the calculation:

   Wm = We * 0.378

where 'Wm' is the weight on Mars, and 'We' is the weight on Earth

Write a command-line program which accepts a series of Earth weights from the user
and displays each Earth weight as itself, and its Martian equivalent.

```
Enter a series of Earth weights (space-separated): 98 235 185

98 lbs. on Earth is 37 lbs. on Mars.
235 lbs. on Earth is 88 lbs. on Mars.
185 lbs. on Earth is 69 lbs. on Mars.
```

## Last First

Write a command-line program that accepts a full name (first and last name) from the user. The program then displays the name in the format last, first.

```
Enter a name (first last): Juan Valdez
Valdez, Juan

Enter a name (first last): Martin Jackson
Jackson, Martin
```
