     Desserted Island Diner believes a meal isn't a meal without dessert. All meals come with
     a free dessert.

     There are three categories of free desserts: "standard", "special", and "ginormous".

     The meal amount determines the dessert category: <= $10 (standard), <= $15 (special),
     > $15 (ginormous). If it is your birthday, an additional $5 is added when calculating
     the category to potentially bump you up to the next delicious category.

     Note: coinage is difficult to obtain on an island, so all money amounts are in whole dollars.
