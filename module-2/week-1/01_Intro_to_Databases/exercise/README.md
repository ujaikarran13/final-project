# Intro to databases exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to practice the important skill of analyzing data in databases using Structured Query Language (SQL).

## Learning objectives

After completing this exercise, you'll understand:

* How to write `SELECT` statements.
* How to order SQL query results using the `ORDER BY` clause.
* How to filter data using the `WHERE` clause.
* How to perform mathematical expressions in SQL statements.
* How to filter data for `NULL` values.
* How to limit SQL query results using the `LIMIT` clause.

## Evaluation criteria and functional requirements

* All of the queries run as expected.
* The number of results returned from your query equals the number of results specified in each question.
* The unit tests pass as expected.
* Code is clean, concise, and readable.

To complete this exercise, you need to write SQL queries in the files that are in the `Exercises` folder. You'll use the `UnitedStates` database as a source for all queries.

In each file, there's a commented out problem statement. Below it, write the query needed to solve the problem. The value immediately after the problem statement is the expected number of rows that the correct SQL query returns.

## Getting started

1. If you haven't done so already, create the `UnitedStates` database. The script to do this is `resources/postgresql/UnitedStates.sql` at the top of your repository.
    > Refer to the [Database setup](https://lms.techelevator.com/content_link/gitlab.com/te-curriculum/intro-to-tools-lms/postgresql/03-database-setup.md) lesson in the Intro to Tools unit for PostgreSQL if you need instructions on setting up the database.
2. Open the `Exercises` folder. The file numbering indicates the suggested completion order, but you can do them in any order you wish.
3. Launch pgAdmin and open each numbered exercise file one-by-one. Write and run the query for the individual exercise. Save the file before moving onto the next exercise.
4. The unit tests project `intro-to-databases-exercise` is in the same directory as this README. You can open it in IntelliJ and run the tests as you did in earlier exercises.

> Note: Make sure to save your changes to the SQL file before running the unit tests.

## Tips and tricks

* `SELECT` statements specify the columns of a table that you want to return from a query. While the values in the `SELECT` statement are usually directly mapped to a column name, you can also alias them using the `AS` keyword.
* The `DISTINCT` clause removes duplicate values from the results.
* The `ORDER BY` clause orders results based on the value in a column. By default, the results sort in ascending order. However, if you want to sort in descending order, you can add the `DESC` keyword after the column name. You can also explicitly state that the sort order is ascending using the `ASC` keyword.
* `WHERE` clauses filter results. Some operators you can use for filtering out data include:
    - `=`, `<>`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
    - `IN(values)`, `NOT IN(values)`
    - `BETWEEN value AND value`
    - `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`
    - `LIKE`, `ILIKE` (with wildcard characters)
* Combine multiple filter conditions using `AND` and `OR`.
* The [`LIMIT`][postgresql-limit] clause can be helpful when you want to reduce the size of the results to a specific number. For instance, if you only want to get five of the rows from a result set, you can do so by specifying `LIMIT 5` at the end of your query. Essentially, this clause truncates results. Keep in mind that this is typically combined with an `ORDER BY` clause if you're looking for the top or bottom results. The [PostgreSQL documentation][postgresql-limit] explains why ordering is important in more detail.
* The PostgreSQL documentation includes a [tutorial for querying database tables][postgresql-how-to-query], as well as [documentation related to the `SELECT` statement][postgresql-select].
